The HIAS Robotics UI allows you to add your robotics projects to HIAS Core. Currently supported robotics projects are [EMAR Mini](https://github.com/aiial/emar-mini "EMAR Mini") however you are free to create your own robotics projects and modify the UI accordingly.

From the Robotics page you can access all robotics projects that are set up on your HIAS network. You can access an interface that allows you to interact with the agent. AI Agents currently supported are Diagnostics, Facial Recognition and Natual Language Understanding.
