# Active Staff

The active staff list provides a list of staff members that currently have permission to access the HIAS UI.

# Cancelled Staff

The active staff list provides a list of staff members that no longer have permission to access the HIAS UI. When a staff member account is cancelled, all of the credentials for accessing the HIAS network are deleted. If you need to reactivate a cancelled account you need to create a new account.

# Create Staff Member

# Edit Staff Member
